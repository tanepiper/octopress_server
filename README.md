# octopress_server
ABANDONED - This is a simple Express + Socket.IO server I am running my static Octopress site behind, to give it little more kick


When I was running a static site, this allowed for dynamic content to be injected and updated live from the server.

The project is abandoned and kept here for archive purposes only.
